# In one of my projects I tracked the what users 
search to undrestand what are the key words
After analysing user behaviour I
noticed new users who just start using the app
instead of searching for exercise name ( bench press, squate,...) they
write in the search box words such as chest, upers chest, biceps, arm, etc.
So I decided to add a feature to the 
exercise list that when a user searchs 
for chest I need to list exercises 
which are relates to chest.The problem is 
that in the exercise list filter
the exercise name while user types
some words in the search textbox field.
The question is how I can search for something
that doesnt exist in my exercise list.
it is something that comes from another table of database.
